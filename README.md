## 🎯 Overview
The app provides a simple, swipe-based UI built with **React Native** and **Expo**.  
While the swipe interface is intentionally minimal, its purpose is to serve as a **foundation for extending** the project — for example, integrating further models, personalization logic, or real-time feedback loops.

## 🧠 Core Idea
Writing a compelling Tinder bio can be a difficult task especially for people who are not good at expressing themselves.  
This project uses **AI-powered text generation** and prompt to help users:
- Allow user to select their [MBTI Personality](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), expressing themselves in their personality styles
- Explore what kind of partner traits they are looking for
- Highlight their unique personality traits
- Convey authenticity and humor
